This project consists in the automatization of an N Scale Model Railroad. At the very first moment -version 0.1-, I'm just using an Arduino mega and a transistor bridge to control the speed and the direction of the train. It's achived by a PWM signal between the rails, therefore, every single train on the railwail will have the same speed and direction. In a further verson, I'd like to control every train individually.

I'm using an arduino LCD shield as interface to control speed and direction.

I'll add more peripheral, as lighting control.


All the code, web and arduino files, can be found here:

Any comment will be appreciated.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
